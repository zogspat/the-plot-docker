Before first run:
* Passwords need to be set in the .env file
* Run the setup.sh script to create an account:  sudo ./setup.sh email add <email address> <password>

To do:
* The python script to scan the logs needs access to iptables. This means the container probably needs the NET_ADMIN capability.
